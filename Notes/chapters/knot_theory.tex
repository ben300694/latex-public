\section{Constructions \& Definitions}


\begin{definition}
	If $K$ is an oriented knot, then
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the \textit{reverse}\index{knot!reverse} $\overline{K}$
		is $K$ with the opposite orientation
		
		\item the \textit{obverse}\index{knot!obverse} $rK$ is
		the reflection of $K$ in a plane
		
		\item the \textit{inverse}\index{knot!inverse} $r \overline{K}$
		is the concordance inverse of $K$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	For $K \subset \sphere{3}$ we have that
	$K \# r \overline{K}$ is slice, even ribbon.
\end{proposition}


\begin{definition}[Homotopically unlinked,
		{\citep[3.F.9.]{rolfsen2003knots}}]
	If $L = L_{1} \cup \ldots \cup L_{n}$ is a link with $n$
	components, we say that $L_i$ is
	\textit{homotopically unlinked} \index{homotopically unlinked}
	from the remaining components if there is
	a homotopy $h_{t}$ from the embedding of $L_{i}$ to the constant
	map such that the images of $h_{t}$ and $L_{j}$ are disjoint
	at all times $t \in \interval$ and for all other components $j \ne i$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	In the Whitehead link both components are
	homotopically unlinked from each other.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
	Homotopic linking (for two component links)
	is \textbf{not} a symmetric relation.

		\caption{Positive Whitehead link,
			picture from \citep{meier2015distinguishing}.}
		\label{fig:positive_whitehead_link}
	\end{marginfigure}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
	A link $L = L_{1} \cup L_{2}$ of two components in $\R^{n}$
	is \textit{splittable} \index{link!splittable}
	if there are disjoint, topological $n$-balls $\disk{n}_{1}, \disk{n}_{2} \subset \R^{n}$
	such that $L_{i}$ lies in the interior of $\disk{n}_{i}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	\marginnote{
		The converse of
		\ref{prop:splittable_implies_homotopically_unlinked}
		is not true, an example
		of van Kampen and Zeeman is discussed
		in {\citep[3.K.5.]{rolfsen2003knots}}.
	}
	\label{prop:splittable_implies_homotopically_unlinked}
	If a link is splittable, then each component is homotopically
	unlinked from the other.
\end{proposition}
	

\begin{definition}
	The lower central series of a group $G$ is defined inductively
	by \marginnote{Observe that $[G, G_{i-1}] = [G_{i-1}, G]$.}
	\begin{align*}
		G_{0} & \coloneqq G \\
		G_{i} & \coloneqq [G, G_{i-1}] = \langle [g, h] \mid g \in G, h \in G_{i-1} \rangle
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	This satisfies:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $G_0 \supseteq G_1 \supseteq G_2 \supseteq \ldots$
		\item each $G_{i}$ is normal in $G$
		\item the quotient $G_{i} / G_{i+1}$ is in the center of $G / G_{i+1}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{lemma}
	\marginnote{Heuristic idea: The length of nonempty words
		in $G_{i}$ increases with $i$, and so only the identity
		(which is the empty word in a free group)
		survives in all steps.}
	If $F$ is a free group, then $\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} F_{i}$ is the
	trivial group.
\end{lemma}


\begin{definition}
	A \textit{metabelian group} \index{group!metabelian} $G$ is a group
	whose commutator subgroup $[G, G]$ is abelian.
	
	Equivalently, $G$ is metabelian if and only if there is an
	abelian normal subgroup $A \trianglelefteq G$
	such that the quotient group $G/A$ is abelian.
	In particular this means that metabelian groups
	are precisely the solvable groups of
	derived length\sidenote{The least $n$
		such that $G^{(n)} = \{1\}$
		is called the
		\textit{derived length} \index{group!derived length}
		of a solvable group $G$.}
	$\le 2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Any dihedral group is metabelian, because
		is contains a cyclic normal subgroup of index 2.
		
		\item The symmetric group $S_{4}$ is not metabelian, because
		its commutator subgroup is the non-abelian alternating
		group $A_{4}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{example}


\subsection{Characterizing the unknot}

\begin{proposition}
	A knot is trivial if and only if its longitude
	represents the trivial element of the knot group. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	This follows from Dehn's Lemma and the loop theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{Dehn's Lemma \citep[4.A.1]{rolfsen2003knots}}] 
	Suppose $M^{3}$ is a $3$-manifold and $f \colon \disk{2} \rightarrow M^{3}$
	is a piecewise-linear map of a disk with no singularities on the boundary, i.e.
	\[
		x \in \partial \disk{2}, x \ne y \in \disk{2} \Rightarrow f(x) \ne f(y).
	\]
	Then there exists an embedding $g \colon \disk{2} \rightarrow M^{3}$
	with $g(\partial \disk{2}) = f(\partial \disk{2})$.
\end{lemma}


\subsection{Branched Coverings}

\begin{definition}[Cyclic covers branched over a knot]
	%TODO
	TODO Insert definition, examples
\end{definition}


\begin{exercise}[{\citep[10.F.2]{rolfsen2003knots}}]
	Find a $600$-fold branched noncyclic covering
	$\sphere{3} \rightarrow \sphere{3}$
	branched over the trefoil.
\end{exercise}

\noindent \textbf{Solution:}
The Poincar{\'e} homology sphere $P^{3}$ appears the
$5$-fold cyclic covering of $\sphere{3}$ branched over the trefoil.
Moreover, $\sphere{3}$ is the $120$-sheeted universal covering of
the Poincar{\'e} manifold, so by composing these we obtain
a $5 \cdot 120 = 600$-sheeted branched covering of the $3$-sphere:

\section{Invariants}

\subsection{Fundamental group of knot and link complements}

\begin{proposition}
	Knot complements $\sphere{3} \setminus K$
	are aspherical.
	\marginnote{
		An space $X$ is called \textit{aspherical} \index{aspherical}
		if all its higher homotopy groups vanish,
		i.e. $\pi_{n}(X) = 0$ for $n \ge 2$.
		
		For a CW-complex $X$ this is equivalent to
		the universal covering $\widetilde{X}$
		being contractible.
		
		By definition, an aspherical space in an
		Eilenberg-MacLane space of type
		$K(\pi_1(X), 1)$.
	}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Uses the Sphere theorem to show that $\pi_{2}$ is trivial.
	$H_{3}$ of the universal cover vanishes because it is non-compact.
	Since the universal cover is a $3$-dimensional manifold we conclude that
	all its homotopy groups are trivial, so it is contractible.
	%TODO
	TODO More details
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	Fundamental groups of knot complements are torsion-free.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	The classifying space $K(\pi_1(\sphere{3} \setminus K), 1)$
	has a finite dimensional model.
	Now a standard argument using that the group homology of
	cyclic groups is nontrivial in infinitely many degrees.
	%TODO
	TODO
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	If $L$ is a non-splittable link, $\sphere{3} \setminus L$
	is aspherical.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
	The fundamental group of a link complement is torsion free.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	The link group is a free product of the groups
	of the non-splittable parts of L.
	Now use that the free product of torsion free groups is
	torsion free. \marginnote{
			In general, all torsion in a free product is
			conjugated to torsion in one of the summands of the free product.
		}
	%TODO
	TODO 
\end{proof}





\subsection{Alexander polynomial}

\begin{definition}
	$L$ oriented link with Seifert matrix $A$, then the first homology of
	the infinite cyclic covering of the link complement, $H_1(X_{\infty} ; \Z)$,
	has square presentation matrix $t A - A^{T}$.
	
	The \textit{Alexander polynomial}\index{Alexander!polynomial} of $L$ is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		\Delta_{L}(t) \doteq \det(t A - A^{T})
	\end{equation*}
	where $\doteq$ means ``up to a multiplication with a unit $\{ \pm t^{\pm n} \}$
	of the Laurent ring $\Z[t, t^{-1}]$''.
	\marginnote{
		\begin{remark}
			$\Z[t^{\pm 1}]$ is \textbf{not} a PID,
			for example the ideal $(2, 1+t)$ has height $2$
			and thus is not principal.
		\end{remark}
	}
\end{definition}




\begin{definition}
	The \textit{tunnel number}\index{knot!tunnel number} $t(K)$ of a knot $K \subset \sphere{3}$ is the minimal number of arcs
	that must be added to the knot (forming a graph with three edges at a vertex) so that
	its complement in $\sphere{3}$ is a handlebody. The same definition is
	valid for links. \\
	The boundary will be a minimal Heegaard splitting of the knot complement
	(The knot complement is a manifold with boundary, so what is the definition
	of a Heegaard splitting in that case?).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	Every link has a tunnel number, this can be seen by adding a ``vertical''
	tunnel at every crossing in a link diagram.
	This shows that the tunnel number of a knot is always less than or equal
	to the crossing number, $t(K) \le c(K)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The unknot is the only knot with tunnel number 0. (Why?)
		\item The trefoil knot has tunnel number 1.
		\item The figure eight knot has tunnel number 1.
	\end{itemize}
\end{example}



\subsection{Unknotting number}

\begin{definition}
	The unknotting number $u(K)$ of a knot $K$
	is the minimum number crossing changes required
	to transform it into an unknot.
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}[\citep{scharlemann1989link}]
	Doubled knots are exactly those knots
	with three-genus and unknotting number $=1$.
\end{proposition}



\subsection{Arf invariant}

\begin{theorem}
	The Arf invariant of a knot $K$ is related to the Alexander polynomial by
	\begin{equation*}
		\Arf(K) =
		\begin{cases}
			0 & \textrm{if } \Delta_{K}(-1) \equiv \pm 1 \textrm{ modulo } 8 \\
			1 & \textrm{if } \Delta_{K}(-1) \equiv \pm 3 \textrm{ modulo } 8.
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
	If $K$ is a slice knot, we know that its determinant
	$| \Delta_{K}(-1) |$ is an odd square integer.
	Thus we have $\Delta_{K}(-1) \equiv \pm 1 \textrm{ modulo } 8$
	\marginnote{$(2k+1)^{2} = 4 k^{2} + 4 k + 1 = 4 \underbrace{k (k+1)}_{\text{even}} + 1
		\equiv 1 \textrm{ modulo } 8$}
	and as such $\Arf(K) = 0$; $\Arf$ is a well defined concordance invariant.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Tristram-Levine $\omega$-signatures}

\begin{definition}[{\citep[Definition 8.8]{lickorish2012introduction},
	\citep[Definition 12.5]{kauffman1987knots}}]
	\marginnote{
		The \textit{$\omega$-signature} is sometimes called the
		\textit{equivariant signature} or
		\textit{Tristram-Levine-signature}.
		\index{signature!$\omega$-, equivariant, Tristram-Levine}
	}
	Let $L \subset \sphere{3}$ be an oriented link and
	$\omega \in \sphere{1} \subset \mathbb{C}$
	a unit complex number with $\omega \ne 1$. \\
	The $\omega$-signature $\sigma_{\omega}(L)$ of $L$
	is defined to be the signature of the Hermitian matrix\sidenote{
		Any Hermitian matrix is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues,
		and the signature is defined as the number of positive minus the number
		of negative eigenvalues. \\
		Sylvester's Law of Inertia states that the signature of a Hermitian matrix
		$B$ is not changed by congruence $C \cdot B \cdot C^{T}$.
	}
	\begin{equation*}
		(1 - \omega) A + (1 - \overline{\omega}) A^{T}
	\end{equation*}
	where $A$ is any Seifert matrix for $L$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	$\sigma_{-1}(L) = \sigma(A + A^{T})$
	is known as \textbf{the} signature of $L$
	or the \textit{Murasugi signature} \index{signature!Murasugi}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	The $\omega$-signature $\sigma_{\omega}(L)$ is a well defined link invariant,
	i.e. it does not depend on the choice of Seifert surface.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Directly check that the signature does not change under S-equivalence.
	%TODO
	TODO Define S-equivalence
\end{proof}

%TODO
TODO The $\omega$-signature can jump at the zeros of the Alexander polynomial
because at those an eigenvalue can cross zero (changes sign)
and is constant in between.

\subsection{Slice knots}

\begin{definition}

	One can connect sum a given slice disk with any knotted
	$2$-sphere to obtain infinitely many non-isotopic
	slice disks for every slice knot.
	To see that this gives non-isotopic disks one can look
	at the fundamental groups of the slice disk exteriors,
	$\pi_{1}(\disk{4} \setminus \Delta)$.
\end{observation}


\begin{definition}[Surgery on a knot in $\sphere{3}$]
	The notation $\sphere{3}_{0}(K)$ denotes the \textit{$0$-surgery on a knot}

	$K \subset \sphere{3}$, i.e. removing a tubular neighborhood
	$\sphere{1} \times \disk{2}$ of $K$ and gluing in $\disk{2} \times \sphere{1}$

\begin{definition}[Trace of a knot]
	For $n \in \Z$ the \textit{$n$-trace of a knot} \index{knot!trace}
	$K \subset \sphere{3}$
	is the $4$-manifold $X_{n}(K)$ obtained by attaching an $n$-framed $2$-handle to the $4$-ball along $K$,
	i.e. 
	\begin{equation*}
	X_{n}(K) = \disk{4} \cup_{K \times \textrm{framing} \colon \sphere{1} \times \disk{2} \hookrightarrow \sphere{3}} (\disk{2} \times \disk{2}).

	$K \# -K$ is smoothly doubly slice.

\begin{remark}
	We can use the standard spinning of this knot to obtain a $2$-sphere
	with cross-section $K \# -K$, but this $\sphere{2} \subset \sphere{4}$
	will be knotted in general.
	We can see this because its knot group 
	is the same as the one of the knot we started with.
	So we cannot use this ``obvious'' sphere to prove that $ K \# -K $ knot is doubly slice.
	
	As an alternative, we can use the (more complicated)
	$\pm 1$-twist spin of our knot to obtain an unknotted
	sphere in $\sphere{4}$ with cross-section
	$K \# -K$ \citep{zeeman1965twisting}.

\section{Property P and R}
% ----------------------

\begin{definition}[Property P, \citep{kirby1978slice}]
	If (nontrivial) Dehn surgery on a knot
	cannot yield a homotopy $3$-sphere
	then the knot is said to satisfy
	\textit{Property P} \index{Property!P}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Kronheimer, Mrowka]
	All knots, except the unknot, have Property P.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Property R]
	If $0$-framed surgery on a knot cannot yield
	$\sphere{1} \times \sphere{2}$ then it
	satisfies
	\textit{Property R} \index{Property!R}.\marginnote{
			We could also drop the condition
			that the framing is assumed to be
			trivial: It is clear from looking at the
			intersection pairing on the trace of the surgery
			that if the result is $\sphere{1} \times \sphere{2}$,
			the framing had to be $0$.
			%TODO More details?
		}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Gabai]
	If $0$-framed surgery on $K \subset \sphere{3}$ is 
	$\sphere{1} \times \sphere{2}$
	then $K$ is the unknot\sidenote{
			In other words:
			All knots, except the unknot, have Property R.
		}.
\end{theorem}


\begin{conjecture}[Generalized Property R, \citep{scharlemann2009fibered},
	{\citep[Problem 1.82]{kirby1995problems}}]
	Suppose $L \subset \sphere{3}$ is an $n$-component
	link with integer framings, and surgery on $L$ gives
	the connected sum $ \#^{n} (\sphere{1} \times \sphere{2}) $.
	
	Then there is a sequence of handle slides on $L$
	that converts $L$ into a $0$-framed unlink.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{remark}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For $n$=1, i.e. a single component, there are no slides
		possible and the statement is Gabai's theorem.
		
		\item For $n > 1$ it is necessary to include the possibility
		of handle slides into the theorem.
		For an example, you can use Kirby moves
		on a zero framed unlink to complicate the link.
		
		\item The only framed links that are relevant for the
		conjecture are those where all framings and linking
		numbers are trivial.

\section{Satellite operators}
% ----------------------

\citep{cochran2014injectivity}

Let $P$ be an oriented knot in the solid torus $\sphere{1} \times \disk{2}$,
this is called a \textit{pattern knot} \index{knot!pattern}.
For $K$ an oriented knot in $\sphere{3}$ we denote by $P(K)$
the (untwisted) \textit{satellite} \index{knot!satellite} of $K$
with pattern $P$. The knot $K$ is sometimes called
a companion\sidenote{You can imagine that the satellite knot
	is orbiting its companion.}
of $P(K)$ \citep[p. 10]{lickorish2012introduction}.

An important special case of satellites are
\begin{definition}[$(p,q)$-cables]
	The \textit{$(p,q)$-cable} of a knot $K$
	\index{knot!cable},
	denoted by $K_{p, q}$
	is the satellite knot with pattern the $(p, q)$-torus knot.
	$p$ is the number of times $K_{p, q}$ transverses
	the longitudinal direction of $K$,
	and $q$ the meridional number.
\end{definition}

We can view a pattern as a function
\begin{equation*}
	P \colon \mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{K}
\end{equation*}
\marginnote{$\mathcal{K} =
	\frac{ \{ \textrm{knots } \sphere{1} \hookrightarrow \sphere{3} \} }{\textrm{isotopy}}$}
on the set of isotopy classes of
knots.
These descent to yield functions (\textit{satellite operators})
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{K} / \sim \rightarrow \mathcal{K}/ \sim
\end{equation*}
for various equivalence relations $\sim$ on $\mathcal{K}$, for example
concordance.

%TODO
If $K$ and $J$ are concordant, their satellites will be concordant
via a concordance which ``follows along'' the concordance between
$K$ and $J$.

\section{Braid groups}
% ----------------------

\begin{exercise}
	Show that there is a presentation for the braid groups
	with just two generators.
\end{exercise}

\begin{definition}[\citep{hedden2010notions}]
	A knot which has a diagram with only positive crossings
	is called a \textit{positive knot} \index{knot!positive}.
	\marginnote{Equivalently, a knot is positive
		if it has a projection for which the writhe
		is equal to the crossing number.}
	
	\textit{Positive braids} \index{braid!positive} are those
	knots and links which can be obtained as the closure
	of a word in the braid group containing
	only positive generators\sidenote{I.e.\ closures of
		products $ \prod\limits_{k=1}^{m} \sigma_{i_{k}} $,
		where there are no $\sigma_{i}^{-1}$,
		and $\sigma_{i}$ is a positive Artin generator.}.
	
	A \textit{quasi-positive braid} \index{braid!quasi-positive}
	is a braid that is a product of 
	conjugates of positive generators\sidenote{
		I.e.\ as products of positive bands
		$\alpha \cdot \sigma_{j} \cdot \alpha^{-1}$,
		where $\alpha \in B_{n}$ is an arbitrary braid word}.
	
	A knot is called
	\textit{quasi-positive} \index{knot!quasi-positive}
	if it is the
	closure of a quasi-positive braid.
	\marginnote{Quasipositive knots are closures
		of braids consisting of arbitrary conjugates of positive generators.
		
		Strongly quasipositive knots require these conjugates
		to be of a special form useful for constructing
		Seifert surfaces.}

\marginnote{A monoidal functor is supposed to preserve the identity
objects for the tensor product. Since the empty set is the identity for the tensor product in the bordism category (given by disjoint union of the bordisms), the TQFT should send this to the identity object for
$\otimes_{R}$, which is just the ground ring $R$.}

\section{Open questions}
% ----------------------

\begin{openquestion}
	Is the crossing number of a satellite knot bigger than that of its companion?
\end{openquestion}

\begin{openquestion}[Smooth unknotting conjecture]
	A $2$-knot is trivial if and only if the fundamental group
	is infinite cyclic.
\end{openquestion}

\begin{remark}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is proved that a $2$-knot exterior
		is homotopy equivalent to $\sphere{1}$ if and only if
		the fundamental group is infinite cyclic
		
		\item Freedman proved the unknotting conjecture in the
		topological category,
		but it is still open in the piecewise-linear or smooth
		category
	\end{itemize}
\end{remark}



\subsection{Open Questions in Knot concordance}

A list of knots whose sliceness status is (supposedly) not known:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $(2, 1)$-cable on the figure eight
	\item Negative Whitehead double of the right handed trefoil
	\item Positive Whitehead double of the left handed trefoil
	\item Any Whitehead double of the figure eight
	\item ...
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Current developments/Recently solved}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Conway knot $11n34$ is not slice, as shown
	in \citep{piccirillo2018conway}
	
	\item Kronheimer and Mrowka found an error
	in their paper \citep{kronheimer2013gauge} which
	(incorrectly?) claimed that Rasmussen's $s$-invariant could
	not detect an exotic $4$-ball. \\
	In particular the methods of
	\citep{freedman2009man} could possibly lead
	to an
	exotic $4$-sphere.
